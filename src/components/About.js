        A battle buddy is a partner assigned to a soldier. Each battle buddy is
        expected to assist his or her partner both in and out of combat. A
        battle buddy is not only intended for company, but also for the
        reduction of suicide; since each watches his partner's actions, a battle
        buddy can save their fellow soldier's life by noticing negative thoughts
        and feelings and intervening to provide help
