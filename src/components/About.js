          My goal for this app is to provide a resource to veterans suffering
          from PTSD to have a means to talk to other veterans. Many of us find
          it difficult to talk about what we did or saw while deployed,
          concerned we will be seen as weak, a monster, and everything
          in-between. Often times civilians find it hard to relate to those
          experience. Here, veterans can find other service members to
          communicate with and a community of support in times of need.{" "}

        <h2>Battle Buddy defined: </h2>
        <h3>
          Battle Buddy - is a partner assigned to a soldier. Each battle buddy
          is expected to assist his or her partner both in and out of combat. A
          battle buddy is not only intended for company, but also for the
          reduction of suicide; since each watches his partner's actions, a
          battle buddy can save their fellow soldier's life by noticing negative
          thoughts and feelings and intervening to provide help
